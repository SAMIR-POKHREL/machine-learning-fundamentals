Titanic Survival Prediction 🚀

Project Type: Classification | Algorithms: Logistic Regression & KNN

Overview

Predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using classification algorithms. This project compares Logistic Regression and KNN to identify the best-performing model.

Key Results
Algorithm:
1.Logistic Regression
2.K-Nearest Neighbors

##Learnings

1.Accuracy alone isn’t enough — precision, recall, F1-score matter

2.Logistic Regression is a strong baseline model

3.KNN requires tuning and scaling

4.Practical implementation improves understanding of model evaluation

#Conclusion

1.Logistic Regression outperformed KNN on the Titanic dataset in terms of stability and overall results.
