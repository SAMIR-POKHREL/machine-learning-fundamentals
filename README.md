Exploratory Data Analysis on Insurance Dataset (Learning Project)
## what I Learned
--converting categorical feature into numerical using label encoding and one hot encoding
--correlation analysis (finding relationship betweeb various features and with output variable )
--using pearson correlation to find which feature has higher relation with output variable
--analyzing the all the features through visualization with the help of maplotlib and seaborn like:
-->boxplot , countplot , histplot
--feature engineering of categorical feature 
--scaling  of some features  using StandardScaler from scipy.
- Chi-square test for categorical features
