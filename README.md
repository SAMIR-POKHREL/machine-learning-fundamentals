## what I Learned
--analyzing the all the features through visualization with the help of maplotlib and seaborn like:
-->boxplot , countplot , histplot
--correlation analysis (finding relationship betweeb various features and with output variable )
--using pearson correlation to find which feature has higher relation with output variable
--scaling  of some features  using StandardScaler from scipy.
--converting categorical feature into numerical using label encoding and one hot encoding
--feature engineering of categorical feature (making new feature from a given feature)
- Chi-square test for categorical features
